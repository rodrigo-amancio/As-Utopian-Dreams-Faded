            THE RISING <br>ANTI-UTOPIA</br>
            <span class="title-tooltip-anti-utopia">In a dystopia, the canonical example is that of 1984. There is total surveillance. Information is gathered about everyone, and this information is used to decide who you are or how to behave. We seem detached from managing our personae in the public world, and managing how we define ourselves. The rhetoric of “Big Brother technologies” is easily—and frequently—ridiculed as “sinister conspiracies”, but the paradoxical result is that genuinely worrisome developments can seem “not so bad” simply for lacking the overt horrors of Orwell’s dystopia. Of course the perceived meaning may depend on the onlooker’s expectations, but now the cycle seems to expand—from utopias and dystopias, to the rise of anti-utopian dreams. <br></br><br><span style="font-family: 'Molde Semibold';">[A]</span>  Goldberg, Adele & Kay, Alan.

Suppose it had enough power to outrace your senses of sight and hearing.</br> <br>These “civilized” desires for flexibility, resolution, and response lead to the conclusion that a user of a dynamic personal medium needs several hundred times much power. (...) We should investigate the possibility of giving each person his own powerful machine.</br> <br>What would happen in a world in which everyone had a Dynabook? If such a machine were designed in a way that any owner could mold and channel its power to their own needs, then a new kind of medium would have been created: a metamedium.</br> <br><span style="font-family: 'Molde Semibold';">[A]</span></br>

                AS UTOPIAN <br>DREAMS FADED</br>
                <span class="title-tooltip-index">Notions of dystopian destruction and surviving the apocalypse are not new. In fact, cyberspace was always about libertarian exceptionalism, transgression and exit, a birth of a space for liberation from state power and bodily limitations. But even as utopian dreams of cyberspace have faded, the hopeful ignorance behind them has endured, giving rise to an everlasting cycle of ideaslism that expands from dystopias and utopias to anti-utopian structures of personalized power. The contrast of expectations on behalf of an intangible space pushed us into a ceaseless world of idealism.</span>
